- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Geeth Wihanga Yapa Boralessa.
- Third-year IT student specialising in Software Technologies, future software engineer. My passion for Information Technology brought me to the Faculty of Technology at South Eastern University. Last semester I completed the Foundation common program, which covers programming, designing, electronics, ethics, social & cloud computing, leadership, languages, E-commerce, maths & statistics and many other areas.
The most valuable lesson I have learned from SEUSL has been "Don't let anything to do in the last minute/hour/day/week", unless you are absolutely capable to do it. 
This year I am mastering Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Software Engineering, Software Testing and Project management. I continue to build skills in UI/UX, data science, c# in .NET framework. Next year, I hope to complete an internship that will provide real-life experience and important technological skills in industry.
